It’s that time of year when my pension statement arrives, which is usually the cause of some amusement. Neoliberalism’s utter failure to provide for a decent existence, exhibit 1:

I earn a decent salary, above the national average, and I’ve been paying into private pensions throughout my adult life. They’ll provide me a grand total of around £300 a month when I retire.
