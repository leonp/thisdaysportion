It’s that time of year when my pension statement arrives – usually the cause of some amusement. Evidence of neoliberalism’s utter failure to provide a decent existence, exhibit 1:

I earn above the national average and I’ve been paying into private pensions throughout my adult life. 41 years’ work will provide me with a grand total of around £300 a month when I retire.
