Gyms in the UK re-opened today, for outdoor classes only. I got to spin for the first time since 23 December, albeit in a carpark gazebo â€“ and it was great.

Absurdly, the last time I was at the gym we could sweat, grunt and breathe really heavily in an enclosed studio, get changed in a cramped locker room, have a shower and then a beer in the restaurant. How fucked up was reopening the first time round?
