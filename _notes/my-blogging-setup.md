My blogging “set up”. MacOS in full screen mode, Typora on the left and Firefox on the right. You can edit Typora themes with CSS, and I’ve set the heading styles so they mimic the website. Jekyll serves the site with an `incremental` switch, which means saves to the markdown file are reflected _fairly_ quickly (about 2-3s at the moment).
