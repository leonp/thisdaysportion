title: Ronnnie and Maggie, Ted and Bet
---

I _love_ this photo.

{% include figure.html url="ronnie-and-maggie.jpg" alt="Black and white photo of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher just outside the White House." caption="Ronnie and Maggie" %}

Reagan looks a bit like my grandad; same hair, rugged western star looks. Ted always wore a suit when he went out. Maggie looks like my gran, Bet, who was a Tory councillor in Ipswich.

I do wonder whether she consciously tried to rock Maggieâ€™s image or whether that was just a look for women from that era (my gran was a year and a bit younger than Thatcher).

Odd mixture of glamour and hard right economics back then, but we are where we are.
