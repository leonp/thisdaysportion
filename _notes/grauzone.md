I had a vague feeling this might have been [a slightly early April’s fool from The Quietus](https://thequietus.com/articles/29782-grauzone-review), because, of course, there had to have been a band called Grauzone from Switzerland in 1981. But this album is great (at first listen), escaping the confines of that dull Gang of Four, “post-punk” sound with bits of Agustus Pablo, bierkeller and some cool synths.
