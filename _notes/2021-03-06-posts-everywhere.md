title: Notes, posts, links are the same thing
---

I publish notes, I publish links, I publish posts. Publish, publish, publish, write about publishing posts, notes and links. — But they’re really all the same thing: 1-500 word missives. So maybe I just need an archive page, or not even that; a home page that lists posts.
