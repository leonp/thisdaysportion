Gutenbergâ€™s `txt` version of <cite>[Anna Karenina](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1399/1399-0.txt)</cite> consists of 2,068,079 bytes, while this [picture of a disused mill between Dunwich and Walberswick](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/images/westwood-marshes-mill-small.jpg) is 245,618 bytes, i.e. 11.9% of the size of the whole of <cite>Anna Karenina</cite>. Online, text is infinitely more _effcient_ in conveying information than images.
