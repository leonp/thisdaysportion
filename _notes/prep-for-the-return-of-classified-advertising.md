Notes for a post on online ads. — If surveillance advertising is made impossible (unlikely, but desirable) then [contextual advertising](https://adactio.com/journal/17658) (ads based on what you’ve chosen to view rather than your browsing history and a host of inferred clues as to your intention/identity at any given time) would be an improvement. But, best of all would be the return of classified advertising, i.e. up front ads hosted on websites made for the purpose of advertising various services (aka Craigslist).

(But – I want to flog you some trainers. You’d love them! How do you find out about them?)
