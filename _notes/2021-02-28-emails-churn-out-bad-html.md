title: Email churns out bad HTML
---

In my last note on how [it’s better to use the web rather than email as means of distributing and editing your content](/notes/2021-02-28-publishing-to-a-website-is-easy), I cited producing good quality HTML as one reason.

Emails are notoriously awful when it comes to generating semantic content. Here’s what the Hey! World service produces. No `<p>`s:

{% include figure.html url="hey-world.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the code produced by Hey World with lots of br tags." caption="Note: Hey World is very much an experiment at the mo, and I guess it’ll be possible to generate ‘proper’ HTML if it develops." %}

Also, what happens when I want to include an image in my post, or anything beyond very simple text?

I have to say, I do like the idea of a really simple, stripped down publication system, but I don’t see why that couldn’t be done on the web (and it in fact it has been – we’ve had services like `feathe.rs` in the past).
