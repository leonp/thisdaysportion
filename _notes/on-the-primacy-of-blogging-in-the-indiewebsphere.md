I thought [this post on the primacy of blogging in the indiewebsphere](https://thedent.net/2021/04/01/greg-morris-the.html) from @AndyNicolaides was interesting as it indirectly touches on a question I’m thinking about: _What is indieweb and who’s it for?_

> When you look into blogging options, there really are very few players in the game anymore and all of them, to one degree or another, feature a technical barrier to enter... If only blogged viewpoints are valid viewpoints then you end up amplifying an already deafening echo chamber of technically minded folks.

There should be a _really_ easy to set up and post to system that can handle essays, notes, images and videos in a couple of taps, as well as conversations that take place on Twitter, Facebook etc. Ideally, there’d be no friction between the various platforms at all – it’d feel like you were posting to Twitter, even though you were publishing a canonical page on your own website.
