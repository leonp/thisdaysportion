title: Remarkable 2 tablet

Think I would like this [Remarkable 2 tablet](https://remarkable.com/).

{% include figure.html url="remarkable.webp" alt="The Remarkable 2 tablet is very thin." caption="Remarkable 2 tablet" %}

I had a real need to sketch a simple diagram of a website section today – the sort of thing that’s best put down quickly on paper rather than constructed in some program or other. But there was no paper or pen to hand. It’d also be cool to email that sketch to someone else.

But £567 for a tablet that only does one thing (include the pen and a cover). That’s only ten quid cheaper than an iPad Air.
