I will say this for WordPress. — Our work intranet has been built on it for three years and handled company updates, comments, training courses, docs and O365 authentication without any problems. The O365 auth plugin was about 18 months out of date, but it updated with no problems this evening. Choose stable plugins and themes and it’s solid and relatively worry free.
