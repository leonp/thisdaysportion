Thinking about :–

* Putting lots of space between big things makes them easier to read, lightens the cognitive load etc.
* It can even convey confidence in what one is saying
* But sometimes you’re building an interface with a lot of information
* Where the aim is to enable the reader to scan/interpret/use this information as efficiently as possible
* So putting lots of well-spaced, big things on the screen is counter-productive
* And conveys arrogance(?)/lack of understanding
* And annoys the user
* Even though the the _look_ of the page may be noisy/dense/cluttered?
* (_Looking at_ versus _using_ again?)
