title: Getting your RSS feed right for social media syndication
mb-cat: ''

---
If [discussion doesn’t take place below the line](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/notes/discussion-doesn-t-take-place-in-the-comments) and you’re publishing everything on your website before syndicating it to social media through your RSS feed, you’ll need to make sure Twitter, micro.blog etc. can make sense of that feed.

If they can’t, you a) won’t get any responses and b) no-one will read what you publish in the first place. I don’t _think_ anyone said indieweb was easy.
