title: The micro.blog universe
mb-cat: ''

Iâ€™m enjoying micro.blog at moment, having spent time bothering to follow people, chat and post short updates.

The micro.blog world _seems_ quite small, even neighbourhoodly, which is cool, but I do like the sense that your bit of, say, Twitter is a mere speck in the universe, and that there are millions of other probably quite weird worlds out there. If micro.blog expanded to Twitter-like proportions, in what ways would it change?
