title: The tyranny of choosing a Netflix series

Saturday afternoon generally consists of listening to [Town on Radio Suffolk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55866935) then some TV while dinner cooks. I’m not fussy about what I watch, and yesterday’s randomish programme was a nature docu called <cite>Stormborn</cite>, which was basically about life in the north Atlantic (killer whale, thrashing seals – you get the idea).
