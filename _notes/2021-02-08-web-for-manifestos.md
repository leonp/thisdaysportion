I’m posting a series of [website aphorisms](/notes/2021-02-08-web-aphorism-5-websites-are-for-them) as part of a refocusing exercise. Obviously, the real world doesn’t allow us the luxury of idealism, but we should strive for purity in some small way. Besides, I do love [a manifesto](https://www.patrickrhone.net/how-i-build-websites-a-loose-manifesto/).
