title: "Website aphorism #5: Your website is for your customers, not you"

We may regard our websites with some fondness (or they may be a millstone), but the effort we spend on creating pages, sections, features, imagery, branding etc. for us, rather than the people who want to do something on the site, is at best inefficient, and at worst stops our customers doing what they want to do.
