I’d somehow missed that the [webmention API](https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/blob/main/README.md#paging) has a `per-page` parameter – handy as my Jekyll API plugin can’t handle paging and doesn’t cache entries. Also discovered a good article on [implementing webmentions on static sites](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/), with a bonus “Fuck off, Nazis!” sentence.
