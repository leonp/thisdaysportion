(In response to [Reply: Discussion doesn’t take place in the comments](http://unseensounds.com/notes/2021/04/29/discussion-comments.html)) – it got through :-) Couple of things: i) I have a comment form switch, so the form only appears on certain posts (but I should maybe reconsider this) and ii) it’s a static site, so webmentions will only appear when I rebuild the site. I _could_ automate this, but it might start costing as I have to pay for build minutes. You’re right, it’s not trivial implementing this stuff, especially on a static site. Cheers for the comment!
