title: Local font signals
---

I’ve come to the conclusion that loading fonts on a blog is unnecessary – the system sans and/or Georgia will do. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t add something like `Fira Sans` to your [stack](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/complete-guide-to-css-font-stacks/); after all, you – and perhaps even your reader – might have installed it locally. That has meaning, and could be a way of signalling something beyond the text between some readers and the writer.
