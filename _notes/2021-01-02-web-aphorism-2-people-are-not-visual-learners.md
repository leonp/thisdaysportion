People are not “visual” (nor verbal, kinetic, social etc.) learners or interpreters of information; to start with, how one learns is a complex thing that will forever be discussed, and is no doubt dependent on a myriad of environmental factors. By using images, video or anything that’s not _words_ you are not necessarily making yourself easier to understand.
