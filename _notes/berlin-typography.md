Very strong want for [Berlin Typography](https://prestelpublishing.penguinrandomhouse.de/book/Berlin-Typography-dt-engl-/Jesse-Simon/Prestel/e575253.rhd) by Jesse Simon, found via an excellent [Tribune article on the meaning of city signage](https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/04/the-signs-that-make-a-city/) by Owen Hatherley. Berlin’s typography is a riot (like most metropolises, I’d imagine) but, to these British eyes, especially exotic, with its umlauts and eszetts, blackletters and geometric and humanist sans.
