See [Labour needs a big idea. But would it use one if it saw it?](https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2021/01/25/labour-needs-a-big-idea-but-would-it-use-one-if-it-saw-it/#comment-874464).

I subscribe to Richard Murphy mainly because he’s very good at explaining (and advocating) ideas such as modern monetary theory. Don’t always agree with him, though. Oh yeah, he’s from Ipswich and went to the same school my kids now go to.

This argument will be voiced a lot. The problem – I think – is that the Blairite faction of the party has retained an inordinate amount of power in the PLP and CLPs, despite accusations of Momentum-led purges. Unfortunately, it’s still stuck in 1997, and doesn’t have a huge amount to offer beyond appearing competent.

I thought this is what <cite>The Guardian</cite> wanted?
