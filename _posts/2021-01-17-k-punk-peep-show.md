title: k-punk and Peep Show
---

I [wgetted](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) [k-punk](http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/) this afternoon, partly in the vague fear that it might disappear one day, and partly because the design is quite old and thus quite unreadable (no `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">`, for example). I may host it on Netlify when I’ve finished smartening it up – I’m assuming that would be legal.

(In case you’re unaware, k-punk is the blog of [Mark Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fisher), a radical writer/blogger who committed suicide in 2017. His best known work was <cite>Capitalist Realism</cite>, an influential and popular post-2008 crash text. Fisher’s politics and interests were not entirely disimilar to mine – Fall fan, Lovecraftian – and he lived in Felixstowe, 12 miles down the road from here, and where I think I’ll retire to.)

Anyway, flicking through k-punk is a diverting way to spend a couple of hours, and quite encouraging in that it starts as a normal blog, ruminating on subjects such as [Peep Show](http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/000528.html).
