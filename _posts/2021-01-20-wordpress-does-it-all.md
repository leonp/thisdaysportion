title: You should try the blogging platform called WordPress
category: web
sub: "It’d be quite cool reading about someone making the journey from, say, Gatsby, to the exciting blogging platform known as WordPress. Better still, it’d be good writing something that wasn’t about making a static site do all the things that WordPress does without any effort."

I was about to write a post about implementing search on a static site, this after spending a day implementing a rustic comments system on a static site.

(Incidentally, actual _search_ on static sites, as opposed to javascript fuelled filtering, is really quite poor compared to sending a traditional search query to a database and getting some more or less relevant results back.)

You’d have thought I’d have realised by now that WordPress provides all this stuff out of the box, and probably needs 30 minutes’ configuration to get everything just right. I mean, I “ditched” WordPress eight years ago (and [blogged about it](/posts/moving-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) (natch)).

Instead of publishing 374 posts on tinkering with Jekyll I should’ve written just one back in 2013 about how it was fun getting my hands dirty with a static site generator, but, no thanks. I’d rather just get on with writing stuff. I’ll get some decent hosting and re-import everything back to WordPress.

I am joking, more or less.

Of course, writing about reading, writing and publishing online is fun. But still, all the time I’ve wasted _tinkering_ with this stuff.
