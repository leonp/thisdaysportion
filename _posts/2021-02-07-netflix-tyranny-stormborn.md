title: Stormborn and the tyranny of choosing a Netflix series
---

Saturday afternoon generally consists of listening to [Town on Radio Suffolk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55866935) then some TV while dinner cooks. I’m not fussy about what I watch, and yesterday’s randomish programme was a nature docu called <cite>[Stormborn](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000q1kd)</cite>, which was basically about non-human life in the north Atlantic (killer whale, thrashing seal – you get the idea).

Now, it’s unlikely I’d _choose_ to watch <cite>Stormborn</cite>, but it popped up and provided a pleasant hour or so of sublime wallpaper and low stakes drama (not for the seal, admittedly). Who isn’t a sucker for Icelandic vistas of vertiginous, dark angles and stony seas? The Ewan McGregor narrative had a weird Oedipal Jordan Peterson undertone, but anyway.

Compare this with the ballache of _finding_ a series on Netflix. The endless scrolling, searches and banal programme blurbs. Sometimes you just want [Auntie](https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-23572,00.html) to provide something that fits your mood – no algorithm, no effort.

(Iceland, yesterday):
