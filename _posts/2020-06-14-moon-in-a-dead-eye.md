title: "Moon in a Dead Eye by Pascal Garnier"
category: thinking
sub: "Garnier is a riot, all done in 160 pages of slangy, sharp ultimately apocalyptic madness. Also: Richard Osman ripped the plot off shamlessly."

I discovered Pascal Garnier serendipitously, shovelling five or so books from a library shelf into a bag before a trip up to somewhere or other flogging [our self-service system](https://dootrix.com/verso/).

It was the [Gallic edition cover of The Front Seat Passenger](https://jacquiwine.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_1889.jpg) (jpg, large) that stood out. Recently, I’ve been reading <cite>House of Government</cite> and <cite>Stalingrad</cite>, absolutely _huge_ books, so I wanted something I could gobble up in a couple of sittings, and that wouldn’t involve complicated propping up and page turning systems. The Garnier book had stuck with me. It looked short, thrillerish — and French. Perfect.

I’m glad to report this was a brilliant book, fitting for lockdown. A group of white, middle class retirees move to _Les Conviviales_, a gated community in the south of France. It’s horrible. The characters go insane in their own varyingly quiet ways, hurtling to an apocalyptic ending.

I _really_ liked the way Garnier used a seemingly loose, down-to-earth style, only to stab you with a pinpoint image, or surprise with some quiet lyricism. Similarly, at times you felt he _might_ be taking the perspective of a “sensible”, male character who never wanted to go to the community in the first place, only for this character to become the most insane of all, philosophising on a cosmic, murderous scale.

It _is_ a bleak book — Garnier is pretty merciless with most of his characters — but it’s also funny and carried the hint of redemption in its fiery climax. Cheered me up no end.
