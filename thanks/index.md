I really appreciate you taking the time to respond.

I’ll take a look at what you sent and, assuming it’s appropriate, I’ll approve it so it’s published on the site.

If I don’t publish the comment I’ll drop you an email explaining why.

If you want an update whenever a comment is published, subscribe to the [comments RSS feed](/comments/feed/index.xml).

Cheers!
