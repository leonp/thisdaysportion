# This day’s portion

This is the personal website of Leon Paternoster. There’s [an impersonal website](https://www.leonpaternoster.com) too.

There’s a [GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](/LICENSE)

You’re free to use this site however you like, with the following provisos:

- Any content you reuse you attribute to me, and link to the original source
- If anything breaks, you don’t blame me :-)

## This is not a Jekyll theme

This repo contains a ton of personalisations that I’d either remove or make into global variables if it was a Jekyll theme. I use Github and Netlify to manage and host the site, so there are a few settings that help get that working.

I’d certainly be a bit more assisduous about using global variables to create things like the RSS feeds. You have been warned.

If you do want to use it for your own website, you’ll need to make some changes so you don’t end up doing things like displaying comments from [This Days Portion](https://www.thisdaysportion.com).

The *_config.yml_* file is relatively well commented, so that should help you. The `_includes` folder is self-explanatory.
