[John McDonnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McDonnell) – back when Labour was a proper party of labour – mooted the 4-day week idea. In England this wouldn’t happen as i) none of the national parties are remotely radical/imaginative when it comes to work, and ii) there’s no strong enough local government layer to implement it.

There’s nothing stopping a company from doing this, though. But for all UK plc’s talk of wellbeing and progressiveness, most companies are run by public-school educated boys who are as radical as mashed potato.
