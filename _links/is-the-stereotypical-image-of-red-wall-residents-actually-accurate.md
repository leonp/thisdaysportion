The answer is no, which is heartening, part of the ongoing process of demystifying the “red wall” and, by extension, other parts of the country – I expect a lot of the findings here apply to my home town of Ipswich.

It’s not just the current Labour leadership that decided to treat “the North” as a stereotypical, illiberal whole – in Starmer’s case by hoiking flags to every available surface in Hartlepool.

Seeing voters in terms of their and their community’s economic interests rather than some Facebook-inflated cultural war has potential – a step in the front foor with the people who didn’t vote for you last time round.
