This is heartening, part of the ongoing process of demystifying the “red wall” and, by extension, other parts of the country – I expect a lot of the findings here apply to my home town of Ipswich.

It’s not just the current Labour leadership that has disastrously followed this approach by hoiking flags to every available surface in Hartlepool. 

Seeing voters in terms of their and their community’s economic interests rather than some Facebook-inflated cultural war has potential – a step in the front foor with the people who didn’t vote for you last time round.
