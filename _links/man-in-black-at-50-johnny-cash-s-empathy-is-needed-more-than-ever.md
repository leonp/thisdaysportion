Johnny Cash was always big in Suffolk, perhaps due to the US airbases or East Anglia’s fairly weird identification with country ‘n’ western. (Ipswich’s radio station Radio Orwell – or Radio Awful as it was unaffectionately known – played back-to-back godawful commercial C&W).

Cash was probably the only artist my grandad and I both liked, and I’m pretty sure we were planning to see him at a concert he was due to play in Suffolk in the mid to late 90s. I seem to remember it was cancelled due to Cash’s ill health.

Cash’s life is filmic in its scope and arc. [Walk the Line](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358273/) is good, but only tells the great man’s personal story – the poverty and loss of his brother, the drug problems and redemption through his marriage to June Carter.

There’s a political and philosophical element of Cash’s life that’s worth exploring – the Christian socialism spoke to lots of people political figures wouldn’t have reached. The story of the Vietnam War is often told through the lens of either the counter-culture or Nixon and his silent majority: Cash had a foot in both camps.
