This is a really lovely, delicate piece on identity and family history. It no doubt seems strange that Georgina’s blackness was ignored or explained away, but when I think of some of the absurd open family secrets I’ve encountered over the years...

Anyway, here's our greyhound (like Georgina’s, she also black; I hadn’t realised these are the hardest to home.)
