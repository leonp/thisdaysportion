This is interesting as it points out that Remain never made an argument for staying _in_ the EU, while Brexit never made an actual argument _against_ the EU itself. But then again, how much was Brexit actually about the EU?

I voted Remain (and would do so again), but this article (like [the Larry Elliott article it refers to](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/31/the-left-brexit-economic-uk)) lists some of the things that makes the EU not-so-great. I’m sure many Remain voters would find it hard to argue against any of these.

But like Larry Elliott, Naughton is perhaps way too sanguine about the harm the current government could do, and at the prospects of a more progressive, left-leaning alternative. Labour hasn’t won an election since 2005, has regressed to a cautious, triangulating leadership and is more split than ever.
