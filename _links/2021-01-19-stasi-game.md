Damn, it looks like my idea for [a police procedural set in the communist bloc](/notes/2021-01-15-esoteric-communism) wasn’t so original after all.

I guess 1982 DDR is a more doable and relatable setting. Of course, some of us actually remember the 1980s – Erich Honecher overseeing a procession of tanks on the TV or Heike Drechsler winning Olympic medals – and it’s been fetishised in programmes like <cite>Stranger Things</cite>.

East Germany was also the most wealthy communist state, and in that regard the most western. There must be a lot to explore in the tension between [relative affluence and style](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2021/jan/06/ute-mahler-images-real-east-germany-in-pictures) and a truly horrendous state apparatus where a good proportion of the population are spying on each other.
