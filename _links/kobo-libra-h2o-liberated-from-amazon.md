This is a good review of the Kobo eReader, comparing the whole package and experience to owning a Kindle. Kobos have played very nicely with Overdrive, who provide [our eBook lending service](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/services/overdrive), for years – they’re great devices. (Note to self: we should probably add something to the work site about choosing a device.)
