So Joseph basically asked [Hans-Joachim Roedelius](https://www.roedelius.com/ ) (Cluster, Harmonia, Eno-collaborator, all round Krautrock god) to provide a mix for his podcast and the great man did! This makes me happy. I have noted how [other German musicians remained similarly accessible](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/notes/2017-01-23-jaki-leibezeit) despite the awesome work they produced; how Krautrock really wasn’t rock’n’roll at all.
