This is a top quality Fall piece containing a LOL Britt Ekland anecdote and some original insight. The everyday occultism is well documented, but it is worth remembering just what a [great chronicler of everyday life and relationships](http://annotatedfall.doomby.com/pages/the-annotated-lyrics/bad-news-girl.html) Mark could be as well. Anyway, I’m glad this looks good and it must be made. Thewlis as MES works best for me because of [Naked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_(1993_film)).
