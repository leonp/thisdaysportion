I subscribe to [Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email/) so I don’t have to open social media. Today’s first story is a frankly terrifying account of how a gentle copy and paste Facebook meme page for older folk became an I’m-storming-the-capitol-bonkers-Q-conspiracy-follow-me-on-Parler stream. Giggle Palooza has 1.6 million followers.

Just ban Facebook. And start by not using it.
