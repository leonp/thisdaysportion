I agree with this post from Mark Root-Wiley which argues that [dropdown navigation menus are best activiated when a user clicks the link](https://css-tricks.com/in-praise-of-the-unambiguous-click-menu/) (or, correctly speaking, button) rather than hovers over it. Adrian Roselli also writes really well on [how to implement this UI pattern](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/06/link-disclosure-widget-navigation.html) accessibly.

This problem came up at work recently, where the hover pattern has been implemented. I predict it will cause some problems for the normal reasons – afforability, dexterity and annoyance – especially considering the age of the audience using the website we’ve created
