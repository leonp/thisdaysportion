title: Advertising online, but nicely
---

I place ads on Facebook.

There you have it. The unexpurgated truth. My dark places revealed.

I work in marketing. What did you expect? I will add that Facebook ads _work_, better than Google search ads and a _lot_ better than LinkedIn ads. They’re cheap and measurable, unlike, say, press or bus ads. I’ll also add I’m marketing a library service – not sugary drinks, libidinous concoctions, bitcoin or neo-Nazism. And I’m also balancing my evil self by extricating us from Google Analytics.

OK.

Facebook ads work for two reasons:

- I can target what I’m advertising. So if I’m promoting a Harry Potter night at Stowmarket Library, I’ll pitch my ad at adults with children aged 8-16 and an interest in Harry Potter living within 5 miles of Stowmarket. If I want to target gun-owning, 40-60 year old Texans who are interested in right-wing politics, I can also do that.
- Facebook ads don’t look like adverts. They just appear in users’ streams as posts like any other.

For this to be possible Facebook collects information about its users and their browsing habits and sells it to advertisers. This is known as surveillance capitalism, and it’s partly responsible for the collapse of the modern world as we know it. Unsurprisingly, even enervated neoliberal states have started to question – and challenge – Facebook’s power and influence over its citizens.

Which brings us back to the library service. How might we market ourselves in a world without surveillance capitalism?

## Contextual advertising

Jeremy posited an [alternative to surveillance advertising where ads are placed within relevant content](https://adactio.com/journal/17658), rather than in front of relevant users.

So if we were trying to reach our Harry Potter loving parents and carers, we’d possibly advertise on the Suffolk Harry Potter fans page (should it exist). I’d have no idea who was visiting that page, but I could be reasonably confident that it might include people who’d come to our event.

Ethically, this is a lot healthier than targeting users directly. How effective it is compared to surveillance advertising, I’m not sure – it would certainly change how we formulate ads. However, I don’t think it solves another major problem with online ads; namely, that no-one wants to look at online ads.

## An extremely brief history of advertising

Pre-internet you saw (or heard) ads either in print (or on other physical surfaces such as billboards and buses) or on TV and radio. Print ads were divided into two categories: <i>display</i> – large, visual ads which appeared in the popular bits of a publication and broadly (but not exclusively) communicated some form of brand, and <i>classified</i> – small, textual ads whch appeared in their own, discrete section towards the back of the newspaper or magazine, offering things like second hand lawnmowers, or less salubrious services. (Sex has always provided a profitable strand of advertising.)

Note, the two could sometimes cross over; for example, Tesco could place display ads pointing customers to an offer on washing powder, while universities could advertise in the classified section of the newspaper around [clearing](https://www.gov.uk/university-clearing-through-ucas), mainly because a classified ad was a lot cheaper than a full page display ad.

This more or less worked, especially in print, as adverts weren’t intrusive – they didn’t get in the way of whatever it was you were trying to read. If you wanted to find a second hand mower, you’d have to seek out the classified section and spend time trawling through it.

Indeed, there was perhaps a “golden age” of display advertising, where ads directly appealed to the aspirations of a wealthy post-war generation. This is the <cite>Mad Men</cite> era, which wage stagnation and increased media and environmental literacy put paid to. In my 80s childhood, you’d often hear the (incorrect) claim that “the adverts are better than the programmes”, as a yuppie couple performed [a dismal courtship while drinking lots of instant coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqz6bHIV_tU).

You do, of course, still see these types of ads – Nespresso and George Clooney spring to mind, but they feel quaint and ineffective. Nespresso pods are very bad for the environment and the company is worse than Apple for locking you into their product. Nespresso is suing Espresso for using a Clooney lookalike to flog their own proprietary pod. We can see all the gruesome stage machinery behind the shots of George Clooney twinkling at the camera. 

## Display ads don’t work online

If display advertising in print and on TV is becoming less effective, it’s even worse on the internet.

For a start, how do you present an advert without shoving it in front of the user while they’re trying to read or do something else? Back when we only viewed web pages on a desktop monitor, we could at least relegate our adverts to a sidebar, but even then they’d *fight* for the user’s attention, by blinking and/or shouting in very bright colours.

Banners were – and in fact still are – a thing. Literally no-one likes them apart from the poor souls trying to sell them.

The problem for contextual adverts is that digital screens are single, self-contained canvases. There are no pages or discrete spaces for adverts. Furthermore, users have far more control of what they see; you can only invoke a page by clicking on a link to it. When I click that link I don’t want to be presented with an advert.

There have been attempts to get round this by displaying ads in a “tasteful”, classified manner, most notably through The Deck network, and, of course, Google Ads placed on websites. Neither has worked – The Deck relied on a small coterie of fairly “trendy”, trusted sites that readers would be more inclined to accept ads from, and no-one clicks on Google Ads on websites. In fact, when was the last time you saw a Google Ad on a website?

And we haven’t even mentioned mobile. There is nowhere to place ads on a phone screen without enraging users.

## Solving the no-one wants to look at adverts problem

We can again refer to print advertising to find a way to get people to look at adverts. As I said, misdirection and obfuscation have always been a part of advertising.

Newspapers and, to a lesser degree, magazines profess to maintain a strict line between editorial and advertising. It should be obvious to the reader what is an advert and what is journalism.

However, the idea of “advertorial” has been around for a long time. It’s a somewhat murky area. An advertiser will pay a publication to publish a “journalistic” piece written or dictated by them. It _should_ be clearly marked as an advert.

Examples are everywhere (and in fact we’ve paid for these pieces in the local press). Here’s an example from <cite>The Guardian</cite>, paid for by Metro Bank:

Facebook – being Facebook – has taken this further by simply not bothering to mark adverts as adverts. Instead, an ad will appear in a user’s timeline just like any other post does. While this may be good for advertisers – my ad isn’t relegated to some part of the screen that will be ignored – it’s not good for democracy that not only is it difficult to tell _who_ is really posting, but it’s also difficult to tell that what I’m reading is in fact a paid-for ad.
