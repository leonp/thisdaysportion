title: Advertising online, but nicely
---

I place ads on Facebook.

There you have it. The unexpurgated truth. My dark places revealed.

I work in marketing. What did you expect? I will add that Facebook ads _work_, better than Google search ads and a _lot_ better than LinkedIn ads. They’re cheap and measurable, unlike, say, press or bus ads. I’ll also add I’m marketing a library service – not sugary drinks, libidinous concoctions, bitcoin or neo-Nazism. And I’m also balancing my evil self by extricating us from Google Analytics.

OK.

Facebook ads work for two reasons:

- I can target what I’m advertising. So if I’m promoting a Harry Potter night at Stowmarket Library, I’ll pitch my ad at adults with children aged 8-16 and an interest in Harry Potter living within 5 miles of Stowmarket. If I want to target gun-owning, 40-60 year old Texans who are interested in right-wing politics, I can also do that.
- Facebook ads don’t look like adverts. They just appear in users’ streams as posts like any other.

For this to be possible Facebook collects information about its users and their browsing habits and sells it to advertisers. This is known as surveillance capitalism, and it’s partly responsible for the collapse of the modern world as we know it. Unsurprisingly, even enervated neoliberal states have started to question – and challenge – Facebook’s power and influence over its citizens.

Which brings us back to the library service. How might we market ourselves in a world without surveillance capitalism?

## Contextual advertising

Jeremy posited an [alternative to surveillance advertising where ads are placed within relevant content](https://adactio.com/journal/17658), rather than in front of relevant users.

So if we were trying to reach our Harry Potter loving parents and carers, we’d possibly advertise on the Suffolk Harry Potter fans page (should it exist). I’d have no idea who was visiting that page, but I could be reasonably confident that it might include people who’d come to our event.

Ethically, this is a lot healthier than targeting users directly. How effective it is compared to surveillance advertising, I’m not sure – it would certainly change how we formulate ads. However, I don’t think it solves another major problem with online ads; namely, that no-one wants to look at online ads.

## An extremely brief history of advertising

Pre-internet you saw (or heard) ads either in print (or on other physical surfaces such as billboards and buses) or on TV and radio. Print ads were divided into two categories: <i>display</i> – large, visual ads which appeared in the popular bits of a publication and broadly (but not exclusively) communicated some form of brand, and <i>classified</i> – small, textual ads whch appeared in their own, discrete section towards the back of the newspaper or magazine, offering things like second hand lawnmowers, or less salubrious services. (Sex has always provided a profitable strand of advertising.)

Note, the two could sometimes cross over; for example, Tesco could place display ads pointing customers to an offer on washing powder, while universities could advertise in the classified section of the newspaper around [clearing](https://www.gov.uk/university-clearing-through-ucas), mainly because a classified ad was a lot cheaper than a full page display ad.

This more or less worked, especially in print, as adverts weren’t intrusive – they didn’t get in the way of whatever it was you were trying to read. If you wanted to find a second hand mower, you’d have to seek out the classified section and spend time trawling through it.

Indeed, there was perhaps a “golden age” of display advertising, where ads directly appealed to the aspirations of a wealthy post-war generation. This is the <cite>Mad Men</cite> era, which wage stagnation and increased media and environmental literacy put paid to. In my 80s childhood, you’d often hear the (incorrect) claim that “the adverts are better than the programmes”, as a yuppie couple performed [a dismal courtship while drinking lots of instant coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqz6bHIV_tU).

You do, of course, still see these types of ads – Nespresso and George Clooney spring to mind, but they feel quaint and ineffective. We know Nespresso pods clog up the oceans and the company is worse than Apple for locking you into their product. They’re suing a competitor – Espresso – for using a Clooney lookalike to flog its own proprietary pod. Consumers can see the gruesome stage machinery behind the shots of George Clooney twinkling at the camera. 

## Display ads don’t work online

If display advertising in print and on TV is becoming less effective, it’s even worse on the internet.

For a start, how do you present an advert without shoving it in front of the user while they’re trying to read or do something else? Back when we only viewed web pages on a desktop monitor, we could at least relegate our adverts to a sidebar, but even then they’d *fight* for the user’s attention, by blinking and/or shouting in very bright colours.

Banners were – and in fact still are – a thing. Literally no-one likes them apart from the poor souls trying to sell them.

The problem for contextual adverts is that digital screens are single, self-contained canvases. There are no pages or discrete spaces for adverts. Furthermore, users have far more control of what they see; you can only invoke a page by clicking on a link to it. When I click that link I don’t want to be presented with an advert.

There have been attempts to get round this by displaying ads in a “tasteful”, classified manner, most notably through The Deck network, and, of course, Google Ads placed on websites. [Neither has worked](/posts/the-deck-and-designers/) – The Deck relied on a small coterie of fairly “trendy”, trusted sites that readers would be more inclined to accept ads from, and no-one clicks on Google Ads on websites. In fact, when was the last time you saw a Google Ad on a website?

And we haven’t even mentioned mobile. There is nowhere to place ads on a phone screen without enraging users.

## Solving the no-one wants to look at adverts problem

We can look to print advertising to see how the Twitters, Facebooks and Googles of this world get people to look at adverts. Pre-online marketing wasn’t inherently more ethical than online marketing – it’s just less intrusive and can’t gather any data on the people looking at it.

Newspapers and, to a lesser degree, magazines profess to maintain a strict line between editorial and advertising. It should be obvious to the reader what is an advert and what is journalism.

However, the idea of “advertorial” has been around for a long time. It’s a somewhat murky area. An advertiser will pay a publication to publish a “journalistic” piece written or dictated by them. It _should_ be clearly marked as an advert.

Examples are everywhere (and in fact we’ve paid for these pieces in the local press). Here’s an example from <cite>The Guardian</cite>, paid for by Metro Bank:

{% include figure.html url="guardian-paid-for-ads.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a list of sponsored articles in The Guardian." caption="An example of advertorial." %}

The idea is that this somehow looks like “proper”, journalistic content, rather than actual adverts.

The history of Google search is the story of how it has tried to merge paid for adverts with what it calls “organic” (i.e. not paid for) results. It’s a fascinating example of how very minor typographical changes can have a major effect on customer experience, and on whether advertising works.

Facebook – being Facebook – has taken a more direct approach to blurring the line between content and advertising. Facebook ads appear in a user’s timeline just like any other post does, but with the word <i>Sponsored</i> placed below the poster’s name in small, low contrast text. This would prove an effective way of misdirecting readers on its own – combine it with the absolute mess of the average Facebook page and timeline and it becomes even more difficult to separate from the noise.

While this may be good for advertisers – my ad isn’t relegated to some part of the screen that will be ignored – it’s not good for democracy when not only is it difficult to tell _who_ is really posting something; it’s also difficult to tell that _what_ I’m reading is an advert at all.

## Classified advertising to the rescue (not really)

I was planning to end this article by suggesting that good old fashioned, honest(!) classified ads could solve both our problems with advertising online. It couldn’t be more contextual – you go to a website and search for whatever you want to find – and the ads aren’t getting in the way of the content because they are the content.

Except that’s not quite true. Classified advertising can also be misleading whenever there’s a middleman looking to make money from serving ads. Indeed, Google search started as a pure classified advertising service that tried to match its results with whatever you were looking for. But once it started selling search results slots, the results become less trustworthy, and more difficult to navigate.

There’s nothing to stop bad faith actors flogging you something that isn’t what they claim it to be, although direct, peer to peer services such as Craigslist can of course work really well. It’s perhaps no coincidence that these types of sites tend have the plainest, clearest interfaces.

But the main problem with classified sites is that they can only real sell you a very specific item that you know you want. What if you’re looking for a pair of trainers, but don’t know which brand would be best? Nike won’t be advertising on Craigslist.
