title: Focusing your writing with a simple scaffolding technique
category: thinking

I’ve been writing a post about advertising online over the last couple of weekends. It’s a subject I’ve been interested in for years, and I can offer some perspective as we place lots of Facebook ads at work (spoiler: they work _really_ well).

I was _fairly_ happy with the post. I liked the tone I’d struck, and I’d turned some punchy, eye-raising passages. But it had got a little flabby, hitting 2000 words. More importantly, the _point_ of it had become unclear, and I began overreaching, trying to draw the thing back together somehow.

Time to start again.

I’m not one for convoluted writing processes. I’ve looked at apps like Obsidian and struggled to find a use for them, preferring to simply draft something and refine it as I go along.

However, I sometimes use a structuring technique which dates back to my university and teacher training days. In this case it really helped sort out my meandering advertising post.

It’s obvious, but you may find it useful.

## The scaffold

{% include figure.html url="scaffold.jpg" alt="Screenshot of notes for a blog post written in Markdown in the Typora editor." caption="I’m using Mardown as it makes the semantic structure visually clear. Word processors have an outline feature you could use." %}

### A title

Don’t sweat this too much in the beginning. You’ll edit it several times as you draft your outline.

### A standfirst (or TL;DR)

Summarise your article in a sentence or two. How would you explain your point to someone who’s not interested in your subject?

It’s worth doing this first as it helps determine your structure, but be prepared to change it as you go along.

### Sections

A post’s argument will usually progress through several basic points. List them here as second level headings. Each should follow on from the last one, so you may want to begin each heading with a connective (<i>but</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>additionally</i>, <i>despite</i> etc.)

A blog post will _usually_ consist of 3-5 sections; if you have more than this I’d suggest going back to your standfirst and reconsidering the point.

Again, be prepared to edit these as you go along.

### Bullet point sub-sections

Within each section you’ll make several points. List them here in short bullet points, and nest when necessary. Some bullets may be an idea for an image or quote. The order of sections and sub-sections may shift as the argument develops.

## Writing’s a fluid process

You can use this scaffolding technique at any point in the writing process. Sometimes it’s useful to dump your thoughts onto the page before trying to structure them better, sometimes you might want to start with this. You might even switch between the scaffold and your draft at various points.

You’ll probably reach a stage where you’re happy with the underlying argument of your blog post and your draft is coming along nicely. At this point, you’ll move from the scaffold to the draft, with a more tightly argued, easier to read post in the offing.
