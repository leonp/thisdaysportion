Daring Fireball [argues that reference hyperlinks are more readable than traditional, inline hyperlinks](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/28/quinn-devforums-markdown).

You don’t see many reference hyperlinks in the wild. They’re academic – a number in brackets after some text which links to a footnote at the bottom of your web page.

[This is an inline hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink). You see hundreds of them every day. Gruber’s right – they’re a lot easier to create than reference links.

They’re also a lot better than reference links, an historical improvement in the construction of texts.
