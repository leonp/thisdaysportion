Daring Fireball [argues that reference hyperlinks are more readable than traditional, inline hyperlinks](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/28/quinn-devforums-markdown).

You don’t see many reference hyperlinks in the wild. They mimic academic footnotes – a number in brackets after some text which links to a footnote at the bottom of your web page, which in turn will link to a source.

[This is an inline hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink). You see hundreds of them every day. Gruber’s right – they’re a lot easier to create than reference links.

They’re also more usable – and readable – than reference links, an epochal development in the construction of texts, possibly the main reason hypertext is more powerful than print.

Why? Well...

**Most web reading consists of skimming and scanning.** And links provide [good information scent](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-scent/). A well turned inline link provides more information to a scanner than a small number in a bracket.

But even if you are reading a longform text in a traditionally linear way, inline links are better.

**Inline links are more accessible.** Not only do they provide more information about what you’re linking to, they’re also easier to click/tap as they’re simply bigger.

**They’re easier to use.** With a reference link the reader has to click/tap a small area, find the relevant link at the bottom of the page and then follow it to its destination. That’s an extra couple of steps.

True, [you can create links within pages](http://www.echoecho.com/htmllinks08.htm), but these are problematic for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they’re counterintuitive – the expected behaviour of a hyperlink is to take you to another web page. Secondly, linking within pages is imprecise, unless the page author styles the target link properly. The reader will most likely be sent to the footnote link’s general area, rather than to the link itself.

**Reference links belong in print.** We know exactly where the bottom of a book page is, but web pages are fluid and intangible. I can create a mental _model_ of a web page and its components by looking at the text and the scrollbar, but I don’t _know_ where the bottom of the page is. It might even move based on what I do.
