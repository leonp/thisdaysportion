title: The perfect blogging platform

If you’re on [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) the chances are you’ve discussed various blogging platforms. A lot. This is one of the charms of the network, and understandable as it follows indieweb principles, which are founded on publishing to your own website before a third party such as Facebook. Some of us also like writing about writing and publishing.

Most bloggers are at best not _too_ unhappy with their blogging platform(s) of choice, whether that’s self-hosted WordPress, Hey World, Medium, Ghost, wordpress.com, micro.blog itself, Craft notes, write.as or a static site generator. There’s a lot of experimentation, moving around and even paying for services; some blogging ubermenschen and dammen are posting to three, four or more platforms. I salute you.

Before building the perfect blogging platform we need to establish some principles. What are we trying to achieve and what do we want to avoid? Here are a few tentative ideas.

## Dedicated to publishing blog posts

One of the main problems I – and, judging by micro.blog, many others – have with WordPress is its development over the decades into a general website publishing service. This seems a strange gripe as it is literally the world’s most popular CMS, so it must be doing something right.

However, it must be odd that your WordPress-company website, whether it’s a shop, reference source or five page brochure for your builder business, places _posts_ so much to the fore. What is a post? Categories and tags? I’m interested in pages, shop items, case studies etc., but blog posts? No.

Conversely, if you are just interested in blogging WordPress offers a a huge array of customisations in the Gutenberg editor. These enable editors to create complex pages and layouts; whether that’s a good idea is a separate matter, but they make simple prose editing unnecessarily complicated.
