Aaron Reed’s [<cite>50 years of text games</cite>](https://if50.substack.com/) newsletter is very much worth a read/subscribe (via [@kottke](https://kottke.org/21/07/from-text-adventures-to-modern-interactive-fiction)) if you’re into computers, programming, gaming, language, writing, politics, narrative, voice, experimentalism or plain old fiction. I think that covers most of you, and ticks all my boxes at once.

> In 2003 she [Shelley Jackson] began a project called *[Skin](https://ineradicablestain.com/skindex.html)*, which called for two thousand volunteers to each tattoo a single word of a new short story on their body: only volunteers who sent proof of  their participation were allowed to read the entire text.

I’ve enjoyed a long, personal history with what I now know as <i>interactive fiction</i> (IF), and _text adventures_ through my teenage years. The name change represents a very general shift in how the activity has viewed itself, from _gaming_ to _writing_, although this being IF it’s not as simple as that; the two concepts have informed and shaped the other, albeit to different degrees and in different ways.

I learned to program by writing parser IF in Spectrum BASIC. In some ways it was incredibly simple – there were no concepts such as scoping and typing, Dictionaries were stored as _sets_ of arrays, rather than in a multi-dime



Although it’s never achieved any commercial success [post-Infocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom), IF has remained a stubbornly relevant form, perhaps especially so now when its central, deceptively tricksy premise – that you control some form of character in a fictional, textual world – is so inherently _fluid_ in its nature, perception and praxis.

This newsletter is an absolute joy of discovery and rediscovery.
