## TLDR

Thinking about how we place ads in a world where there’s no tracking looks at the problems advetising poses in the wrong way. The blurring of editorial/content and adverts points to an even more dystopian future where there is no essential difference between the two. The web _is_ advertising.

## The question we may be thinking about: how do we advertise effectively without tracking?

- Why is it a question?
  - Collects lots of information about us which we hand over to unknown parties
  - Can be used by bad faith actors to influence behaviour
- Why would that be a problem?
  - Facebook advertising works!
- What are the proposed answers?
  - Contextual advertising
    - Good, but still relying on good faith of host and actor – you can still place rightwing ads by content about football, gaming etc.
  - Classified advertising

## Why is this not the whole story?

- Facebook ads work for three reasons:
  - Tracking
  - Everybody uses Facebook
  - Ads don’t look like ads

The third point is important.

## The blurring of content/editorial and advertising

We don’t know whether what we’re looking at is “genuine” content or editorial. This has two weird effects:

- The line between the two blurs (Bladerunner where adverts form the cityscape; ads and content are the same thing)
- Adverts become more trusted(?)

- Happens in several different ways
  - Placing an advertorial (note that this has happened for years in print, and old fashioned adverts themselves sometimes felt like editorial)
  - Hiding ads within a stream
    - Google ads
    - Facebook
  - The content becomes advertising (Ronaldo posts ads for Nike boots on Twitter)
  - Editorial sites become more opinionated, peddling adverts for a particular political point as news:
    - The Observer and Corbyn
