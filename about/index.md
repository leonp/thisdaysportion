This is my blog, and I am [Leon Paternoster](https://www.leonpaternoster.com).

{% include figure.html url="mr-leon-paternoster.jpg" alt="Leon Paternoster with scruffy hair wearing a green jumper." caption="March 2021." %}


I write about lots of things – mainly designing and building things online, but also politics, books, music and other cultural _stuff_.

At the moment I seem to be writing about writing and publishing a lot, which may or may not be of interest over time.

I used to post everything to leonpaternoster.com, but that’s now just where you find the work me. The world has become more LinkedInified, or perhaps I’ve just got older — careers progress, older posts become a bit of a no-no work wise and everything gets dumped elsewhere, i.e. here. I still fundamentally _believe_ in blogging and, at the very least, writing and hitting publish is good for me.

## Contact

If you’d like to get in touch, email **mail@thisdaysportion.com** Alternatively, you can follow me on Twitter: [@leonpaternoster](https://twitter.com/leonpaternoster/) where I have a locked account. Better still, contact me on [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/leonp) — I auto-post there at the moment, but I do keep an eye on it and I’m taking longer and longer hiatuses from Twitter.

I’m also on LinkedIn, but the whole point of this website is to not be like I’m on LinkedIn.

_This day’s portion_?

Ambitious (tone – declamatory):

> Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day <br><cite>– Exodus 16:4</cite>

And personal, referential (also declamatory):

> Little boys are taking over<br>
> They mumble through the grass<br>
> They are not fit to be in the company<br>
> Of vulperines and wolverines<br>
> Too many heads knocking about<br>
> Service<br>
> This day’s portion<br>
> This day’s portion<br>
> This day’s portion<br>
